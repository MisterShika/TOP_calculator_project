# TOP_calculator_project

This is a project from The Odin Project (TOP) to create a calculator.

I'm using these projects as a way to balance out my coding style from just using FP to being able to acclimate to OOP as well.

Simultaneously, I'm also using these exercises as a way to practice GIT and GIT best practices.
